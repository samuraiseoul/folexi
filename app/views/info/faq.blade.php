        What is FOLEXI?<br>
        FOLEXI is a vocabulary learning game who aims to make learning
        foreign language vocabulary fun and interactive.<br>
        Where does the name come from?<br>
        The name comes from the "FO" in "Foreign" and the "LEXI" from
        "Lexicon".<br>
        How do I play?<br>
        To play click the link in the header that says "GAME". The controlls are
        quite simple. At the top of the page you will see a text box and three 
        vocabulary words. Type the word corresponding to the enemies coming at 
        you on the screen to advance to the next round of vocabulary words.
        Red enemies have to be shot twice. Purple enemies kill surrounding
        enemies. And green enemies slow down surrounding enemies.
